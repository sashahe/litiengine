## Project

Name: LITIEngine

URL: https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine

The LITIEngine is an open source game engine for developing 2D games in Java.

## Architectural overview (optional, as one item for P+)

## Selected issue(s)

Title: Generalize Ability system #115 

URL: https://github.com/gurkenlabs/litiengine/issues/115
    
Description: Make the ability class more general, as it is now it requires a creature. This could be more general by not requiring this.


## Onboarding experience

##### Did it build as documented?
There are no clear guidelines regarding specifically how to build the project, however, there is a file describing how to contribute to the project. Since there is a gradle directory in the project, it can be assumed that gradle is used. Thus, building the project is in fact easy. Aside from downloading Gradle, no additional tools are need to build the software and no additional components were installed when building. The build included compilation as well as testing and no errors occurred during the build of the project, thus the tests are successful. The build was run with the command `gradle build`.

## Requirements affected by functionality being refactored
An ability is initialized with an executor. In the current state this executor must be a creature. The methods within the ability class that involve the executor are:

| Function                        	| Requirements on executor:                                                                                                                         	| Requirements for testing:                                                                                                                                                                                                            	|

| Ability()                       	| Current implementation requires the executor to be a Creature.
